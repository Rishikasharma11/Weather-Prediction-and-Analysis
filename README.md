 Weather Prediction and Analysis
This project leverages NumPy, Pandas, and data science techniques to analyze and predict weather patterns. The goal is to build an interactive platform that offers insightful visualizations and accurate weather predictions based on historical data.

Features:
Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of weather datasets to identify trends and seasonal patterns.
Weather Prediction: Utilizes predictive algorithms to forecast future weather conditions.
Visualizations: Graphical representations of weather trends using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.
Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the data and visualize predictions in real-time.
Technologies:
NumPy & Pandas for data handling and manipulation.
Streamlit for creating a user-friendly interface.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization.
